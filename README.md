# CustomDrawerView
SwiftUI drawer modal that opens from the bottom of the screen. Perfect for providing user's additional information without navigating to an entire screen.

The user has a few ways to close the drawer: Tapping the dark background, dragging the drawer closed, tapping the close button, or any method provided by you.

Very flexible and should accommodate any content.

# Example: 

The text telling how many times the drawer has opened or closed is meant show how the various provided closures behave. This is an elementary example. In practice, you'd likely want to start an animation, etc when the drawer finishes opening or closing.

# Some customization ideas:

The "close" button is a bit unoriginal. Could be some image or similar that fits your design

The top-right and top-left corners of the drawer could be rounded. This may fit into most designs better as rounded edges are generally preferred.
